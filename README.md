# Hangman game
 Hello welcome to Hangman game is my personal project to practice in python. 
 If you hasnÂ´t played hangman game yet, I will explain the game: 
## What is it about? 
The goal of the game is guess the word according with its length, you have to click on a letter that you think would be the correct letter. 
- If the letter is correct you will see the letter put utomatically in the right place, this letter is a clue to guess the word more quickly. As you guessing the correct letter you eventually will guess the word.
- If the letter is incorrect letter you will see a part of Rudolf on the screen. As you put the incorrect letter the Rudolf eventually will dead with a leash.

So please save Rudolf  :smile:
